Growing up, there has not been any athlete that I held the most admiration towards, other than Kobe Bryant. The reason why I picked up a basketball and pushed myself through rigorous workouts was because I was inspired to be better than Kobe Bryant. From his "Killer Insinct" to his absurd work ethic not only inspired me more ny change my perception on life. Basketball is my refuge my santcuary. For this project, I will love to create a page in honor of the Greatest of All Time.
